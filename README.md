### Project Title
Investigating a relational database

### Description
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. This was the first project that had to be submitted in order to graduate from Udacity's Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree program:https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree-with-R--nd118

### Software
SQL

### Files
