### Project Title
Investigating a relational database

### Description
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. This was the first project that had to be submitted in order to graduate from Udacity's Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree program:https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree-with-R--nd118

### Software
SQL

### Files

### Credits
This project would not have been possible without the help and guidance received from Udacity's course: AI Programming with Python. Also, there are a few blogs/ articles/ websites of individuals referenced in the .html file that helped me immeasurably to complete this project.
